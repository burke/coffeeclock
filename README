This is an espresso alarm clock. It brews espresso at the end of a 20-minute nap (or whatever else -- that part of it is written in ruby, and very simple to change).

I made some minor modifications to a Saeco Via Venezia espresso machine ($229 CAD at Starbucks) to interface with an Arduino. the Arduino communicates with a computer via USB/Serial. That computer runs a program called serproxy that exposes the serial connection via a TCP port. My macbook connects to this TCP port over the local network to issue commands and do other alarm-y things when the timer expires. 

Photos and more diagrams coming soon.
